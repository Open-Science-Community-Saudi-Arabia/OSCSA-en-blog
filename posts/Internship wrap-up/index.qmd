*Hi all, hope you all are doing fine!*

Welcome to my blog Outreachy series.My Outreachy internship ended, itâ€™s 3 months already, Iâ€™m excited to be completing my internship with the **Open Science community Saudi Arabia**.

The past three months have been filled with *immense growth* and *positivity for me*, fair to say it has been a *life-changing experience*. I still canâ€™t forget the day I received the e-mail about being selected as an *Outreachy intern*, it was one of the best days 

 During my Outreachy internship,  I worked on exciting tasks inluding:
 
 -    Localisation of OERs to introduce Open Science Practices for novice learners adding to that writing documentation using Markdown and writing Blogs to document my internship journey to encourage others. 

 -    I also developed my fron-end web development skills by adding new sections at the [OSCSA website](https://osc-ksa.com/).

 -    Adding to that, I participated in [Write the Docs Prague 2022 Conference](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2022/) that will happen on the 11th of Sept with **Melissa Black** and all that was done thanks to the help of **the turing way community** and especially my mentor **Batool Almarzouq**!


Itâ€™s been an experience that I would recommend to anyone who wants to step into contributing to **open source**. It was very *rewarding personally* and also about the *progress of my skills and confidence*.

Outreachy as an experience will stay close to my heart forever,it's a great journey interacting and getting to know the **Open Science community Saudi Arabia** and **Turing Way community** virtually. Overall, I would say my internship has been a success because I was able to *gain practical skills*, *work in a fantastic environment* that is really inclusive, and *make connections* that will last a lifetime. I could not be more thankful.

And finally, again I would like to thank my mentor Batool Almarzouq,the Open Science community Saudi Arabia and Turing Way community I got to learn many new things from them.

![Thank-you-so-much](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73066984/188339240-4432f202-0d15-4042-9650-c7b9db62a1b2.jpg)

This is *NOT a goodbye*, because I am still going to continue **contributing to this community**ðŸ˜Š.
