*Hi all, hope you all are doing fine!*

Welcome to my blog Outreachy series. In this blog post, I will be discussing my career interests because it is time to set **new goals** and decide what to do next.

I am a final year Telecommunications Engineering Student\*\* and currently I'm doing my **Outreachy Internship** working with OSCSA. During my Outreachy internship, I worked on exciting tasks inluding:

-   Localisation of OERs to introduce Open Science Practices for novice learners adding to that writing documentation using Markdown.

-   I also developed my fron-end web development skills by adding new sections at the [OSCSA website](https://osc-ksa.com/).

I am happy to present some of my work in [Write the Docs Prague 2022 Conference](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2022/) on the 11th of Sept. All that was done thanks to the help and guidance of my mentor [Batool Almarzouq](https://batool-almarzouq.netlify.app/)!

After Outreachy, I wish to further develop my open science skills and I'll be also looking for an internship for 4 to 6 months that will start in February as a full-stack developer intern.

My background is in Front-end and Back-end development but I have also been exposed to Cloud Computing and Computer Security. I am good in MERN and MEAN stack thanks to the past internship and to the several projects I mad at university .

I am proficient in *C++* , *python* and somewhat comfortable with *Java*. I participated a lot in competitive programming such as **TCPC**, **IEEExtreme** and [**Leetcode**](https://leetcode.com/Asma_Kacem)

I alos became comfortable with using git, Github and Markdown during Outreachy!


I am an enthusiastic and social person who loves to take up new challenges and learn new skills. I love meeting new people, exchanging ideas, and spreading knowledge and positivity. Also, I love **working in teams** and **contributing to open source projects** where I can gear up my skills and knowledge.
