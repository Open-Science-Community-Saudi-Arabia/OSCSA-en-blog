    "text": "I‚Äôm very excited to be officially starting my time as an Outreachy participant contributing to the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA). I‚Äôm Asma Kacem, a student from Tunisia that will graduate the next year.I pursue Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I love all types of sports, especially BasketBall.\n\nWhat is Outreachy?\n\n\n\n\n\nOutreachy is a diversity initiative that provides paid, remote internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technology industry where they are living. The goal of Outreachy is to increase diversity in open source.\nMy core values are Challenge, Responsibility, and Kindness.\n\nChallenge - Life without challenges will certainly feels duller I think. I face my challenges head on. There‚Äôs no time to waste in this life, and it‚Äôs either you pursue you challenges or the challenges will pursue you down to disappointment. I think the former is better option.\nResponsibility - Being responsible becomes an unavoidable thing as we all grow older. Taking ownership of your work and life is not easy but very important to live a good and fulfilling life.I have always felt that taking responsibility has helped me be more serious with my work and perform better.\nKindness - is something that is most needed in the world we live in today.Taking care and considering other people whenever we can not only help them but will also help us. I am still not good enough to say that kindness is my core value, but it is quite important for me. I would like it to be one of my core values some day in future, and till then, I will try to be more kind each day.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs a quote!\n\n‚ÄúSet a goal,you‚Äôve got one shot make it count‚Äù\n\nFor anyone who is considering, I highly recommend applying as well! It can be intimidating to make your first contributions to open source (I remember how nervous I was making my very first PR), but the community and my mentor helped me a lot. And to go out of your comfort zone for a small time and then a little more each time, it really is rewarding and you‚Äôll learn so much.\nThanks for reading. üí´‚ú®\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{kacem2022,\n  author = {Asma Kacem},\n  title = {Hello {Open} {Source} {Enthusiasts!}},\n  date = {2022-05-30},\n  url = {https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asmaa-intro/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAsma Kacem. 2022. ‚ÄúHello Open Source Enthusiasts!‚Äù May 30,\n2022. https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asmaa-intro/."

    "text": "Hello Everyone!\nWelcome to the second blog post for the Outreachy series! This blog‚Äôs topic is ‚ÄúEveryone Struggles‚Äù.\n\n\n\nstrug\n\n\nFor me, I am not facing any particular issues at this stage. Just sometimes I feel I still don‚Äôt know when to stop googling and ask the questions. But thanks to this opportunity, it teach me to ask for help from a more experienced person and my mentor when I‚Äôm stuck, it will save me a lot of time.\nEverything is going well, I‚Äôm learning very interesting new topics related to my field of study it was challenging but with the help and guidance of my mentor, everything become easy.\nThe bright side of all the struggle and hard work is that we learn and get out of our comfort zone. So the advice I can give is to believe in yourself. You‚Äôll learn new things and start gaining confidence gradually.\nTo conclude, all I can say is to develop the habit of asking for help when you are stuck. It will save you a lot of time. Also, do not be too hard on yourself. Make sure to maintain a healthy lifestyle and get some rest when stressed. Sometimes maybe the reason you can‚Äôt figure things out is that you are tired or hungry. Lastly, never doubt yourself. If you can make it this far then you definitely can accomplish your project.\n\n\n\nstruggle\n\n\nThanks for reading. üí´‚ú®\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@misc{kacem2022,\n  author = {Asma Kacem},\n  title = {Everyone {Struggles!}},\n  date = {2022-07-22},\n  url = {https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asma-struggles/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAsma Kacem. 2022. ‚ÄúEveryone Struggles!‚Äù July 22, 2022. https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asma-struggles/."

    "text": "My name is Richie and I am a 2022 Outreachy intern. I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria. I am really happy to intern with the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia project. As time goes on i will be sharing my experience and what I have learnt so far.\nI love to learn, share, and discuss a wide range of topics. I am ambitious, and driven individual who is always looking for new ways to challenge yourself and improve. I have a passion for learning and i‚Äôm always seeking out new opportunities to grow and develop my skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nAside coding, i enjoy solving puzzles and taking on tasks that seem difficult, i believe nothing is actually difficult. In my opinion, tasks only seem difficult is you lack the undelying foundational knowledge. Most times, most of what we call ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù are basically blocks of knowledge stacked together, with each block having interconnected chains to different foundational basic knowledge. Learing new things only take time and patience. I am a very patient person and i am always willing to learn new things. I am also a very creative person, i love to think outside the box and i am always looking for new ways to solve problems.\nI am a very friendly person and i love to meet new people. I am also a very open minded person, i am always willing to listen to other people‚Äôs opinions and i am always willing to learn new things. I am also a very patient person, i am always willing to learn new things and i am always willing to learn new things.\nI look forward to getting to make valuable connections and impact others positively.\nThanks again for joining me\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{moluno2022,\n  author = {Richie Moluno},\n  title = {Introducing Myself},\n  date = {2022-12-06},\n  url = {https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/richie-intro/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRichie Moluno. 2022. ‚ÄúIntroducing Myself.‚Äù December 6,\n2022. https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/richie-intro/."
