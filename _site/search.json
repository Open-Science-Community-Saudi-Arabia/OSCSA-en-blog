    "text": "I’m very excited to be officially starting my time as an Outreachy participant contributing to the Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA). I’m Asma Kacem, a student from Tunisia that will graduate the next year.I pursue Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I love all types of sports, especially BasketBall.\n\nWhat is Outreachy?\n\n\n\n\n\nOutreachy is a diversity initiative that provides paid, remote internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technology industry where they are living. The goal of Outreachy is to increase diversity in open source.\nMy core values are Challenge, Responsibility, and Kindness.\n\nChallenge - Life without challenges will certainly feels duller I think. I face my challenges head on. There’s no time to waste in this life, and it’s either you pursue you challenges or the challenges will pursue you down to disappointment. I think the former is better option.\nResponsibility - Being responsible becomes an unavoidable thing as we all grow older. Taking ownership of your work and life is not easy but very important to live a good and fulfilling life.I have always felt that taking responsibility has helped me be more serious with my work and perform better.\nKindness - is something that is most needed in the world we live in today.Taking care and considering other people whenever we can not only help them but will also help us. I am still not good enough to say that kindness is my core value, but it is quite important for me. I would like it to be one of my core values some day in future, and till then, I will try to be more kind each day.\n\nAnd here’s a quote!\n\n“Set a goal,you’ve got one shot make it count”\n\nFor anyone who is considering, I highly recommend applying as well! It can be intimidating to make your first contributions to open source (I remember how nervous I was making my very first PR), but the community and my mentor helped me a lot. And to go out of your comfort zone for a small time and then a little more each time, it really is rewarding and you’ll learn so much.\nThanks for reading. 💫✨\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{kacem2022,\n  author = {Asma Kacem},\n  editor = {},\n  title = {Hello {Open} {Source} {Enthusiasts!}},\n  date = {2022-05-30},\n  url = {https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asmaa-intro/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAsma Kacem. 2022. “Hello Open Source Enthusiasts!” May 30,\n2022. https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asmaa-intro/."

    "text": "Hello Everyone!\nWelcome to the second blog post for the Outreachy series! This blog’s topic is “Everyone Struggles”.\n\n\n\nstrug\n\n\nFor me, I am not facing any particular issues at this stage. Just sometimes I feel I still don’t know when to stop googling and ask the questions. But thanks to this opportunity, it teach me to ask for help from a more experienced person and my mentor when I’m stuck, it will save me a lot of time.\nEverything is going well, I’m learning very interesting new topics related to my field of study it was challenging but with the help and guidance of my mentor, everything become easy.\nThe bright side of all the struggle and hard work is that we learn and get out of our comfort zone. So the advice I can give is to believe in yourself. You’ll learn new things and start gaining confidence gradually.\nTo conclude, all I can say is to develop the habit of asking for help when you are stuck. It will save you a lot of time. Also, do not be too hard on yourself. Make sure to maintain a healthy lifestyle and get some rest when stressed. Sometimes maybe the reason you can’t figure things out is that you are tired or hungry. Lastly, never doubt yourself. If you can make it this far then you definitely can accomplish your project.\n\n\n\nstruggle\n\n\nThanks for reading. 💫✨\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@misc{kacem2022,\n  author = {Asma Kacem},\n  editor = {},\n  title = {Everyone {Struggles!}},\n  date = {2022-07-22},\n  url = {https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asma-struggles/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAsma Kacem. 2022. “Everyone Struggles!” July 22, 2022. https://oscsa-en-blog.netlify.app/posts/asma-struggles/."
